# acorn-release

## Package It (For Developers)

To package, open a terminal @ acorn-release
`npm install`

For mac presently, though adjustments for linux can easily be made:
`nix-shell --run acorn-release`

This will produce an Acorn.app file within `Acorn-darwin-x64` folder. This can be zipped and shared.

## To develop

Run `npm install` and `npm start`

`main.js` is a primary point of development.
